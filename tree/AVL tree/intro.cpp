Almost all operation in a binary search tree
are of order O(h) where h is the height of the tree
.................AVL Tree........................
1)also called height balanced tree
2)balanced factor = heigth of right subtree - height of left subtree
3)height difference between heights of left and right subtrees
for every node is less than or equal to 1.
4)can be -1,0,1 for a node to be balanced in a BST
5)can be -1,0,1 for all nodes of an AVL tree  
Rotation is done to make assure that the AVL tree is balanced

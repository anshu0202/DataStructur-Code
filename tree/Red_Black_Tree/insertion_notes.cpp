1)If tree is empty create newnode as root 
node  with black colour.
2)If root is not empty then create newnode as leaf node 
with red colour
3)If parent of newnode is black then exit.
4)If parent of newnode is Red, then check the colour of parent's sibling
of newnode
a)If colour is black or NULL then do suitable rotation & recolour
b)if colour is red then recolour & also check if parent's
 parent of newnode is not root node then recolour it & recheck
 ************************************************************
 We have to check three things 
 1)root = black
 2)no two adjacent red nodes
 3)count no. of black nodes in each path

Its a non linear data structure which is a
collection of nodes connnected through edges
nodes are also called vertices
It is used to model real world problems like managing a social network, website
It is use to model path in a city,social network,website back links,
internal employee network.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
*** A graph is collection of vertices and edges connecting these vertices
*A vertex or node is one fundamental unit/entity of which graphs are formed
*An edge is uniquely defined by its 2 end points
*Direct edge-> one way connection
*undirected edge-> Two way connection
*Directed graph ->All directed edges
*Undirected graph->All undirected edges

*Indegree-> No. of edges going out of the node
*Outdegree-> No. of edges coming into the node

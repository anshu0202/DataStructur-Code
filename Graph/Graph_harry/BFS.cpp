/*
In BFS, we start with a node and start exploring its connected nodes.
The same process is repeated with all the connecteing nodes until all 
the nodes are visited.

Method of BFS traversal
Method 1->BFS spanning tree
1)We can start with any source node
e.g 0 and construct a tree with 0 as a root node
2)mark all the sideways or dulpicate edges( above a node)  as dashed
3)This constructed tree is called as BFS Spanning Tree
4)Level order Traversal of a BFS spanning tree is a valid BFS
traversal of a graph
Method 2->
We can start with any queue and store them in exploration queue and visited queue
